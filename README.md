## How it's made:
**Tech used:** Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Materialize 

### Frontend 
I use [materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) for the front end and write a little CSS on the public folder

### Backend
Express server running on Node environment that listen to requests from the client and connect to a MongoDB database. It can add, retrieve and delete items from the db collection. The PUT and DELETE method are fetched from the client side JavaScript.

## Optimizations
I'm working on creating user authentication and the ability to generate multiple shopping list saved by date created 

## Lessons Learned: 
I learn to create a full stack app(node, ejs, express)!! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯, learn to use materialize css to generate fast and visually appealing UI, and I create code to make the quantity of every item don't go below 0 (It was a cool moment ðŸ˜Ž) Oh ! I learned too that deploying is harder than coding a fulls stack app ðŸ˜†
